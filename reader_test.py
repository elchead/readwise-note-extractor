## ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me

How my life / behavior / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.

I've become more aware of my priorities and keeping enough time to engage in what is important to me.

I no longer define myself through my job achievements.

I believe that it is most valuable to follow your passion.

## üìí Summary + Notes

### Doing

Actions, not words, reveal our real values.

"As an example, a friend was trying to decide whether to stick with his frustrating job or quit to start his own company. Options: build company outside of office hours and quit when its sustainable; show up at work and secretly work on your own company until they fire you; propose the idea to the boss and start it as a division..."

### Goals

Goals shape the present, not the future. If it was a great goal, you would have jumped into action already.
